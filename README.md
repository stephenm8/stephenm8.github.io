# stephenm8 github page

##I am taking CIT 281 this spring, here are some things I have learned to this point:

- Project 1: Basic Unix Shell commands, Github overview, and Installing and configuring Git using the Unix Shell.
- Project 2: A web API is an API accessed using the HTTP Protocol, Web API's often deliver data formatted as JSON, and a web API can be accessed programmatically using JavaScript.
- Project 3: Using jQuery to post AJAX requests/repsonses, using NodeJS and Express for testing a server, and using jQuery, JavaScript, and public API's to fetch JSON data, then usig it to refresh part of a web page.
